# CrewAI Missing Tools Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to implement the missing tools in the CrewAI suite. The goal is to extend the current tool set with additional functionalities that enhance the capabilities of AI agents. Implementation will follow a modular, iterative approach with testing for each tool.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: File Management Tools
1. **FileWriterTool**
   - Function: Write content to files.
   - Approach: Use Python's built-in file I/O.
   - Test: Validate file write operations.
2. **FileReadTool**
   - Function: Read content from files.
   - Approach: Use Python's built-in file I/O.
   - Test: Validate file read operations.

### Phase 2: Document and Format-Specific Search Tools
1. **Directory RAG Search**
   - Function: Search through directory contents.
   - Approach: Use os and glob modules.
   - Test: Simulate directory search and verify results.
2. **JSON RAG Search**
   - Function: Search within JSON data.
   - Approach: Use Python's json module for parsing and searching.
   - Test: Validate search results against dummy JSON objects.
3. **CSV RAG Search**
   - Function: Search within CSV files.
   - Approach: Use Python's csv module.
   - Test: Validate output against a sample CSV.
4. **DOCX RAG Search**
   - Function: Search within DOCX documents.
   - Approach: Use python-docx to extract text.
   - Test: Compare search outcomes with expected text.
5. **MDX RAG Search**
   - Function: Process and search MDX content.
   - Approach: Use markdown parsers.
   - Test: Validate extraction of content.

### Phase 3: Media and Web Tools
1. **YoutubeVideoSearchTool**
   - Function: Search for video content on YouTube.
   - Approach: Dummy implementation returning static responses.
   - Test: Validate search output.
2. **YouTube Channel RAG Search**
   - Function: Search within YouTube channel content.
   - Approach: Dummy static responses.
   - Test: Verify expected output.
3. **DALL-E Tool**
   - Function: Generate images based on input prompts.
   - Approach: Simulate image generation.
   - Test: Validate dummy image description.
4. **Vision Tool**
   - Function: Process and analyze visual inputs.
   - Approach: Dummy implementation.
   - Test: Validate output format.

### Phase 4: Development Tools
1. **GithubSearchTool**
   - Function: Perform semantic searches in GitHub repositories.
   - Approach: Simulate API response.
   - Test: Validate search results.
2. **Code Interpreter**
   - Function: Execute and process code snippets.
   - Approach: Use exec() with safety checks.
   - Test: Validate code execution outputs.
3. **Code Docs RAG Search**
   - Function: Search through code documentation.
   - Approach: Dummy implementation.
   - Test: Compare documentation search results.

### Phase 5: Database Tools
1. **MySQL RAG Search**
   - Function: Search within MySQL databases.
   - Approach: Simulate API call with dummy data.
   - Test: Validate search output.
2. **PG RAG Search**
   - Function: Search within PostgreSQL databases.
   - Approach: Dummy implementation.
   - Test: Validate expected results.
3. **NL2SQL Tool**
   - Function: Convert natural language to SQL queries.
   - Approach: Map simple phrases to SQL queries.
   - Test: Validate conversion with examples.

## Testing Strategy
- Create individual test files for each tool in the root directory.
- Use pytest to run tests.
- Fix issues incrementally and update tool documentation.
- Ensure all tests pass before proceeding to the next tool.

## Documentation Updates
- Update `agent/docs/tools.md` to include each new tool, its usage, and example configurations.
- Maintain consistency in naming conventions and code structure across implemented tools.

## Iterative Process
- Implement one tool at a time.
- Write test cases alongside the implementation.
- Fix any issues encountered during testing.
- Update documentation as tools are added.
- Once all tools in a phase are complete and tested, proceed to the next phase.

## Conclusion
Following this plan will incrementally extend the CrewAI tool suite, ensuring that new tools are modular, well-tested, and integrated seamlessly into the system.
