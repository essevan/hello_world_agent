# Advanced Implementations Guide

## Overview
This guide covers advanced features and configurations for the Hello World Agent, including OpenRouter and LLM settings, streaming capabilities, and using multiple LLMs.

## OpenRouter and LLM Settings

### OpenRouter API
The agent uses the OpenRouter API for LLM access. Ensure you have a valid API key and set it in the `.env` file:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Configuring LLMs
You can configure LLM settings in the `agent/config/agents.yaml` file. This includes selecting the LLM model, setting parameters, and defining behavior.

### Example Configuration
```yaml
llm:
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 1500
  top_p: 0.9
```

### Using Multiple LLMs
To use multiple LLMs, define them in the configuration file and specify their usage in the agent's logic:

```yaml
llms:
  primary:
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    temperature: 0.7
  secondary:
    model: "gpt-4"
    temperature: 0.5
```

In `agent/main.py`, implement logic to switch between LLMs based on task requirements.

## Streaming Capabilities

### Enabling Streaming
The agent supports streaming responses for real-time interaction. Enable streaming in the configuration file:

```yaml
streaming:
  enabled: true
  buffer_size: 1024
```

### Implementing Streaming
In `agent/main.py`, implement streaming logic to handle data in chunks. This allows for responsive interactions and efficient data processing.

## Advanced Use Cases

### Dynamic LLM Selection
Implement logic to dynamically select LLMs based on task complexity or user preferences. This can be achieved by analyzing the input prompt and choosing the appropriate model.

### Custom LLM Parameters
Customize LLM parameters for specific tasks. For example, increase the temperature for creative tasks or reduce it for factual responses.

### Multi-LLM Collaboration
Leverage multiple LLMs to collaborate on complex tasks. For example, use one LLM for data analysis and another for generating reports.

## Best Practices

1. **Security**: Keep your API keys secure and do not hard-code them in the source code.
2. **Performance**: Monitor LLM performance and adjust parameters for optimal results.
3. **Scalability**: Design your agent to scale with additional LLMs and increased data loads.
4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test advanced configurations to ensure stability and reliability.

## Conclusion
Advanced implementations allow you to harness the full potential of the Hello World Agent. By configuring OpenRouter and LLM settings, enabling streaming, and using multiple LLMs, you can create a powerful and flexible agent tailored to your needs.
