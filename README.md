# Hello World Agent üåü

A powerful, extensible agent framework leveraging ReACT methodology for autonomous task execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install the package:**

   ```bash
   pip install hello_agent
   ```

2. **Set up your environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following:

   ```env
   # OpenRouter API Key
   # Get your API key from https://openrouter.ai/
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

   # Optional: LLM Model Settings
   # Default models are set in agents.yaml, but can be overridden here
   # RESEARCHER_MODEL=anthropic/claude-2
   # EXECUTOR_MODEL=anthropic/claude-2
   # ANALYZER_MODEL=anthropic/claude-2

   # Optional: Debug Mode
   # Set to true to enable additional logging
   # DEBUG=false

   # Optional: HITL Settings
   # Enable/disable human-in-the-loop by default
   # Can be overridden with --hitl flag
   # HITL_ENABLED=false
   ```

3. **Run the agent:**

   ```bash
   python agent/main.py
   ```
